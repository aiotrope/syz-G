# xzymous

Xzymous is a web app project submitted in partial fulfillment of LUT's CT30A3204 course. The application's architecture which consists of server-side deployed as serverless function and client-side code is separately published on the internet and maintained in a single git repository. The client side, which acts as a single-page application, can send HTTP requests to the server, providing the resources such as users, posts, and comments. Anonymous users can only access some of the resources through `GET` requests through rendered data on the website; otherwise, users must authenticate to the system to execute further interactive operations.

<a name="requisite"></a>
### ü§î Requisite

Basic understanding of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack web development.

<a name="tech-stack"></a>
### ü§ñ Tech Stack

The author chose the technological stack in the project based on his prior experiences with the stack, the application of technologies covered in the `CT30A3204` course curriculum, and the motivation to try something new to carry out an extra feature to the app built. 
`Vite` was used as a build tool to scaffold the project on the client side instead of `Create React App` due to faster hot module reloading. 
The aim for uniformity between the backend and frontend code during development phase led to the optional decision of the author to implement `Babel` transpilation to CommonJS on production.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of technologies used in the project.

**Client:** React, Axios, TanStack Query, Recoil, Bootstrap, Sass

**Server:** Node, Express, Jsonwebtoken, Mongoose, Babel

**Database:** Mongodb

**Frontend development tool:** Vite

**Unit and e2e testing tools:** Jest, Supertest, Cypress

**Deployment:** Vercel

### üéì Lessons Learned

The main issue I had when working on this project was determining the right¬†tool and environment for a variety of tasks¬†while also efficiently managing my time. I intended to write both the front-end and back-end in Typescript to be included as a feature of the project, however the development took longer than expected due to my lack of Typescript know-how. To meet the needs of time, I turned to Javascript for this matter. I'm certain that I can give the codes in TS, but time is now my adversary, and I'm worried that I won't be able to finish the project on time. I don't think I'm wasting time on that portion, but sitting in front of my computer, configuring, retooling my project at the same time reviewing TS gives me a sense of unfinished work, especially as the clock approaches a deadline. TS is good, however I think I'll use it on personal projects that offer me plenty of time.

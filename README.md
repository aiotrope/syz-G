# xzymous

Xzymous is a web app project submitted in partial fulfillment of LUT's CT30A3204 course. The application's architecture which consists of server-side deployed as serverless function and client-side code is separately published on the internet and maintained in a single git repository. The client side, which acts as a single-page application, can send HTTP requests to the server, providing the resources such as users, posts, and comments. Anonymous users can only access some of the resources through `GET` requests through rendered data on the website; otherwise, users must authenticate to the system to execute further interactive operations.

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned

Apart from my goal of writing readable code, the main challenge I faced while working on this project was the options for choosing the best tool and environment for a variety of jobs and effectively managing my time. I intended to write both the front-end and back-end in TS, but due to my lack of Typescript technical knowledge, the development progressed took longer than expected. I changed to Javascript as the primary coding language of this project. I am sure I can deliver the codes in TS, but time now is my adversary, and I worry that I won't be able to finish the project on schedule.

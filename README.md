# xzymous

Xzymous is a web app project submitted in partial fulfillment of LUT's CT30A3204 course. The application's architecture which consists of server-side deployed as serverless function and client-side code is separately published on the internet and maintained in a single git repository. The client side, which acts as a single-page application, can send HTTP requests to the server, providing the resources such as users, posts, and comments. Anonymous users can only access some of the resources through `GET` requests through rendered data on the website; otherwise, users must authenticate to the system to execute further interactive operations.

### ü§î Requisite

Basic understanding of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack web development.

<a name="tech-stack"></a>

### ü§ñ Tech Stack

The author chose the technological stack in the project based on his prior experiences with the stack, the application of technologies covered in the `CT30A3204` course curriculum, and the motivation to try something new to carry out an extra feature to the app built.
`Vite` was used as a build tool to scaffold the project on the client side instead of `Create React App` due to faster hot module reloading feature.
The aim for uniformity between the backend and frontend code during development phase led to the optional decision of the author to implement `Babel` transpilation to CommonJS on production.
Node version `v18.16.1`, yarn version `1.22.19` and [N](https://github.com/tj/n) nodejs package manager was used for development setup.

### üå± Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file.

- For `server` directory, the .env must be located at the root of `xzymous` directory.

- Port `8080` is preconfigured by default in the `server`.

- For the `client` directory, place the .env file in the client folder's `src` directory.

- MongoDB credentials and connection were established via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), however locally installed MongoDB will suffice.

- The backend also suggests obtaining [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) such as such as the `API KEYS`, `API SECRET`, `CLOUD NAME` and `PRESET NAME`. To your account, add new `upload preset` and set it to `unsigned`. Clodinary integration is only optional and the app will run even without it but image upload cannot be tested.

### ‚ú® Features

The projected points for each feature are solely dependent on the author's perspective.

\*Basic/mandatory requirements includes: Implementation of backend with Node.js, utilization of database(MongoDB), authentication(JWT),
post new code snippets, comment on existing posts, users who are not logged in can view posts and comments, there is a page that lists all of the posts; when opening a post, the comments are also listed, responsive design, and documentation.

| `Adding security to production web app`                | `5`    |

- **Deployment:** I think that any new web app should be tested online and must be configured f production deployment with different environment setup

- **Backend unit test:** Additional unit test dedicated to backend can be a good practice

- **Update user profile:** This feature can give the `req.user` permission and control to the object created

- **User can delete their comment:** This feature can give the `req.user` permission and control to the object created

- **User can add or update profile image:** This feature can give the `req.user` permission and control to the object created

- **User can delete their account:** User has the right to delete their data from any system without traces

- **Adding security to production web app:** On the production app, user validation form input, sanitising user input, protecting the database from any type of malicious attack, and so on are all taken into account

### üéì Lessons Learned

The main issue I had when working on this project was determining the right¬†tool and environment for a variety of tasks¬†while also efficiently managing my time. I intended to write both the front-end and back-end in Typescript to be included as a feature of the project, however the development took longer than expected due to my lack of Typescript know-how. To meet the needs of time, I turned to Javascript for this matter. I'm certain that I can give the codes in TS, but time is now my adversary, and I'm worried that I won't be able to finish the project on time. I don't think I'm wasting time on that portion, but sitting in front of my computer, configuring, retooling my project at the same time reviewing TS gives me a sense of unfinished work, especially as the clock approaches a deadline. TS is good, however I think I'll use it on personal projects that offer me plenty of time.
I also learned to prioritise the project's mandatory requirements before adding extra features that can slow down development.

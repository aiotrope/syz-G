# xzymous

Xzymous is a web app project submitted in partial fulfillment of LUT's CT30A3204 course. The application's architecture which consists of server-side deployed as serverless function and client-side code is separately published on the internet and maintained in a single git repository. The client side, which acts as a single-page application, can send HTTP requests to the server, providing the resources such as users, posts, and comments. Anonymous users can only access some of the resources through `GET` requests through rendered data on the website; otherwise, users must authenticate to the system to execute further interactive operations.

### ü§î Requisite

Basic understanding of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack web development.

<a name="tech-stack"></a>
### ü§ñ Tech Stack

The author chose the technological stack in the project based on his prior experiences with the stack, the application of technologies covered in the `CT30A3204` course curriculum, and the motivation to try something new to carry out an extra feature to the app built. 
`Vite` was used as a build tool to scaffold the project on the client side instead of `Create React App` due to faster hot module reloading feature. 
The aim for uniformity between the backend and frontend code during development phase led to the optional decision of the author to implement `Babel` transpilation to CommonJS on production.
Node version `v18.16.1`, yarn version `1.22.19` and [N](https://github.com/tj/n) nodejs package manager was use for development setup.

### üå± Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file.

For `server` directory the .env must be located at the root of `server` directory. Port `8080` is not configured by default and must be specified as an environment variable. For the `client` directory, place the .env file in the client folder's `src` directory.

MongoDB credentials and connection were established via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), however locally installed MongoDB will suffice.

The backend application also requires credentials to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

```bash
# server .env file e.g.
PORT=8080
MONGO_URL=<MONGO_CONNECTION_URL>
MONGO_URL_TEST=<MONGO_CONNECTION_URL> # MongoDB connection for test environment
LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Client side base URL. Must be set as-is
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING>
CLOUDINARY_NAME=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_NAME>
CLOUDINARY_KEY=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_KEY>
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_SECRET>
CLOUDINARY_PRESET_NAME=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_PRESET>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Client side base URL. Must be set as-is
ORIGINAL_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Client side base URL. Must be set as-is
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 # Server side base URL. Must be set as-is

```

```bash
# client .env file e.g.
VITE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 # Server side base URL. Must be set as-is
```

### üéì Lessons Learned

The main issue I had when working on this project was determining the right¬†tool and environment for a variety of tasks¬†while also efficiently managing my time. I intended to write both the front-end and back-end in Typescript to be included as a feature of the project, however the development took longer than expected due to my lack of Typescript know-how. To meet the needs of time, I turned to Javascript for this matter. I'm certain that I can give the codes in TS, but time is now my adversary, and I'm worried that I won't be able to finish the project on time. I don't think I'm wasting time on that portion, but sitting in front of my computer, configuring, retooling my project at the same time reviewing TS gives me a sense of unfinished work, especially as the clock approaches a deadline. TS is good, however I think I'll use it on personal projects that offer me plenty of time.

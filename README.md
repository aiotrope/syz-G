# xzymous

Xzymous is a web app project submitted in partial fulfillment of LUT's CT30A3204 course. The application's architecture which consists of server-side deployed as serverless function and client-side code is separately published on the internet and maintained in a single git repository. The client side, which acts as a single-page application, can send HTTP requests to the server, providing the resources such as users, posts, and comments. Anonymous users can only access some of the resources through `GET` requests through rendered data on the website; otherwise, users must authenticate to the system to execute further interactive operations.

### 🎓 Lessons Learned

The main issue I had when working on this project was determining the right tool and environment for a variety of tasks while also efficiently managing my time. I intended to write both the front-end and back-end in Typescript to be included as a feature of the project, however the development took longer than expected due to my lack of Typescript know-how. To meet the needs of time, I turned to Javascript for this matter. I'm certain that I can give the codes in TS, but time is now my adversary, and I'm worried that I won't be able to finish the project on time. I don't think I'm wasting time on that portion, but sitting in front of my computer, configuring, retooling my project at the same time reviewing TS gives me a sense of unfinished work, especially as the clock approaches a deadline. TS is good, however I think I'll use it on personal projects that offer me plenty of time.
